"""Stomp Protocol Connectivity

    This provides basic connectivity to a message broker supporting the 'stomp' protocol.
    At the moment ACK, SEND, SUBSCRIBE, UNSUBSCRIBE, BEGIN, ABORT, COMMIT, CONNECT and DISCONNECT operations
    are supported.

    This changes the previous version which required a listener per subscription -- now a listener object
    just calls the 'addlistener' method and will receive all messages sent in response to all/any subscriptions.
    (The reason for the change is that the handling of an 'ack' becomes problematic unless the listener mechanism
    is decoupled from subscriptions).

    Note that you must 'start' an instance of Connection to begin receiving messages.  For example:

        conn = stomp.Connection([('localhost', 62003)], 'myuser', 'mypass')
        conn.start()
