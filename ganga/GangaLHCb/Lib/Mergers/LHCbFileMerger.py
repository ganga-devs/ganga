    """A merger object for LHCb files

    The merger uses DaVinci to combine DST files that have
    been returned *locally* in a job's outputsandbox. As such
    it is mainly useful for microDST files.

    The usage is as with other merger objects. See the help for 
    TextMerger or RootMerger for more details.

    Example:

    lhcbm = LHCbFileMerger()
    lhcbm.files = ['dv.dst']

    This object can be attached to a job object or 
    used to merge a list of jobs with its merge 
    method.

    It is possible to overide the default opts file
    for performing the merge. A new opts file can 
    be provided via the 'merge_opts' field. This should
    be done with care, as some opts are assumed when
    writing the files for output.

    Comments and help requests should be sent to:
