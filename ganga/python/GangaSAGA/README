INTRODUCTION

  This is the ganga IBackend for SAGA. It should run out of the box if,
  and only if you have SAGA & the SAGA Python bindings installed on your
  system and added to you PYTHONPATH.

  If you have no idea what that means, you probably want to check out the
  SAGA website: http://saga.cct.lsu.edu

  If you have any questions, feel free to send me an email:

EXAMPLE: 

  Here's an example how to submit a job to a Globus GRAM2 gatekeeper
  through ganga/saga:

j = Job()
j.backend = SAGA()
j.backend.jobservice_url  = "gram://queenbee.loni-lsu.teragrid.org"
j.backend.filesystem_url  = "gsiftp://queenbee.loni-lsu.teragrid.org:2811//work/test"

j.application.exe = "/bin/cat"
j.application.args = ['/proc/cpuinfo']

j.submit()
