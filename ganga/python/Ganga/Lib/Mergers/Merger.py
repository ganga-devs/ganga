    For large text files it may be desirable to compress the merge
    result using gzip. This can be done by setting the compress
    flag on the TextMerger object. In this case, the merged file
    will have a '.gz' appended to its filename.

    insensitive way. If a file extension is not recognized than the file will be ignored if the
    ignorefailed flag is set, or the merge will fail.
