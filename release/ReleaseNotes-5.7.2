Ganga 5.7.2 Changes...

GangaLHCb-23-26:
1) Fixed the registry corruption error.

Note 5.7.X includes several new features, please see release notes for 5.7.0 below.

***************************
Ganga 5.7.1 Release Notes:
***************************
GangaLHCb-23-25/GangaLHCb-23-24/GangaLHCb-23-23/GangaLHCb-23-22:
Addressing minor testing issues

GangaLHCb-23-21:
No major new functionality, merely a bug fix release. (For information about new features, see
release notes for 5.7.0 appended below)

updates...
1) Fixes for the major bug introduced migrating to the prepared state where InstallArea was 
flattened.
2) Relaxation of the inputdata in optsfile restriction introduced in 5.7.0
3) Hopefully Fix of leakage from master job inputsandbox into subjob inputsandbox.
4) misc other minor fixes.

***************************
Ganga 5.7.0 Release Notes:
***************************
Minor Changes:
Changed NIKHEF-USER -> SARA-USER SE token

Major Changes:
1) Prepared State
Incorperated the prepared state for applications. Prepared applications can be run on different
inputdatasets without having to repackage up the users release area.

try 
j=Job(application=DaVinci(),backend=Dirac())
j.prepare()

Note: applications are automatically prepared upon submit if not done so already.

2) Tasks Framework
Incorperated the tasks framework for database query driven analysis of data. Can type
help(LHCbAnalysisTask) for more information but basic usage is as with jobs but modified slightly,
see below.

tr = LHCbAnalysisTransform()
tr.application = DaVinci()
tr.backend = Dirac()
tr.query = BKQuery('/LHCb/Collision11/Beam3500GeV-VeloClosed-MagUp/Real
Data/Reco11/Stripping15/90000000/DIMUON.DST')

t = LHCbAnalysisTask()
t.appendTransform(tr)
t.run()

Then at a later date, update all transform attached to a task from the database using
t.update()

3) BKQuery object Migration tool
For those who have BKQuery objects stored in their box, there is a compatability problem between the
old BKQuery object and the new tasks framework. Any new BKQuery objects stored in 5.7.0 will be
readable but those created and stored in pre 5.7.0 will not. These older BKQuery objects can be read
if you switch back to a pre 5.7.0 release, or you can run the migration tool to convert them into
new objects as follows.

fixBKQueryInBox()

then restart your session. In case of any problems, this migration tool attempts to back up your
BKQuery objects first and they can be restored from this backup as follows.

restoreOLDBox()
