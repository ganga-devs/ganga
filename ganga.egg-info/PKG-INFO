Description: Ganga
        =====
        
        Ganga is a tool to compose, run and track computing jobs across a variety of backends and application types.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Ganga can be installed using the standard Python tool ``pip`` with
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install ganga
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Ganga primarily runs as a command-line tool so can be started by just running
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            ganga
        
        Which will load an interactive IPython prompt at which you can type
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            j = Job()
            j.submit()
            j.peek('stdout')
        
        to create a simple local job which runs an executable which simply prints some text to the stdout.
