"""Dashboard monitoring services based on MSG.

DashboardMS contains an abstract monitoring service base class.
LCGAthenaMS etc. contain concrete backend/application-specific monitoring service classes.
LCGAthenaUtil etc. contain utility functions for retrieving meta-data specific to a monitoring service class.

N.B. This code is under development and should not generally be used or relied upon.

N.B. The class structure should be reviewed and refactored when a second combination of backend/application is implemented.
