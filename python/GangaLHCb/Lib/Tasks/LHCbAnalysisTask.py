## to do...
##1) Multi threading, even with multi threads, bottle neck at the server while updating.
##2) Check prepared works(looks like does because of application.clone())
##3) Dirac bulk submit
##4) Sort out job resubmission on failure - done
##5) Mergers - done
##6) submit_counter for master job = 1 always unless whole job resubmitted. - done
##7) Partition updating from completed by manual resubmit - done

    """LHCbAnalysisTask - Top level class that looks after groups of LHCbAnalysisTransforms.

    The LHCbAnalysisTask class looks after the running of LHCb Analysis jobs, including helping to keep
    them up to date when new data is added or removed.

    Create a task using the following syntax

    In[1]: t = LHCbAnalysisTask()

    Append a transform to the task as below:

    In[2]: tr = LHCbAnalysisTransform()
    In[3]: t.appendTransform(tr)

    Or use an existing transform as a template to clone many new transforms, each with their
    own bookkeeping query (BKQuery) object.

    In[4]: t.addQuery(tr,[BKQuery('<dataset1>'), BKQuery(<dataset2>)])

    To set task running, do:

    In[5]: t.run()

    Can view the tasks registry by using either of the following

    In[6]: tasks          # less verbose
    In[7]: tasks.table()  # more verbose

    A Pretty, operational view of all the partition and subjobs within a task can be obtained with.

    In[8]: t.overview()
    
    Finally can update all the transforms within a task with.

    In[9]: t.update()"""
