                <h2>What is it</h2>
                <p>The aim of the ARDA project is to provide the LHC experiments tools for Distributed Analysis
                of their data on the gLite middleware provided by the EGEE project (Enabling Grids for E-sciencE).</p>
                <p>It is currently collecting information related to jobs and data transfers running on the grid
                environment, as well as additional information concerning the state of the several services 
                involved (grid and experiment specific).</p>
